## Introduction
The total number of vehicles worldwide is increasing every year.</br>
It mean that Car accidents can occur all the time all the way. </br>
However there are some conditions were the probabilities of have an accident arise due multiple variables. </br></br>
This report has as purpose develop a model for Seattle government to predict the probabilities of have a car accident and severity, based on different conditions as weather or road conditions. </br></br>
The information was provided by Seattle Police Department form 2004 to 2020. </br>

</br></br></br>
## Business Problem
Identify the conditions that can cause future car accidents in order to alarm the people with anticipation to be aware and drive more carefully.
</br> In an effort to reduce the frequency of car collisions in a community, an alogorithm must be developed to predict the severity of an accdient given the current features.</br></br></br>
It will give us THREE BIG benefits : </br></br>
__1. Save lives as main benefit </br>__</br>
__2. Reduce costs in damage infrastructure</br>__</br>
__3. Reduce cost from police and paramedics to attend each accident__</br></br></br>
